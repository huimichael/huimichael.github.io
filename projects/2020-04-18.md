This project is the same as the Database System Part 1 project but instead done in C++ with the implementation of classes. Like the previous one, the task was to build a bank simulation program that had a user interface. Having the same options such as adding, modifying, checking, and deleting. It used the data structure of linked lists, these lists contained elements of the user such as their name, address, and code. The new addition to this project is the usage of object-oriented programming. It has the same functions but added restrictions with private and public functions. It still contains the same idea of having to read and write files. With two new functions reverse and cleanup. The reverse function reverses the entire linked list, swapping the head and tail, this function has to be implemented with recursion. And the cleanup just deletes all records in the linked list.

With how this project is structured, it is the same as the previous one but with a new way of approaching it. In all honestly, this project was not difficult as my part 1 project was near perfect in terms of carrying out its task. In this project, I was more on the side of finding ways of improving the user-interface. I tried many things that made the program simpler to understand as well as making it easier for the user to input int and string responses. One of the changes I did that made a difference was the decision to use switch cases for my menu, instead of if statements. It made the menu "smoother" as well as the menu improvements easier to implement. Overall when completing this project, I was proud of the work done, not because it works the same as last time, but instead, I was able to improve and refine certain aspects.
