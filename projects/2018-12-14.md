This was a computer science assignment done in my senior year of high school. The assignment was to create a text style RPG game done in Java. It had to include basic functions such as inheritance, loops, arrays, and topics we have covered so far in the semester. My game uses a turn-based system with inspiration from the video game series “Dark Souls,” where you would have bosses to defeat to progress in the game. The player has access to things such as items and potions. The game uses inheritance, how there would be a player class, and below those would be child classes such as knight, archer, bandit, etc. I based my class system off of a mobile game I was interested in at the time “Fate/Grand Order.” Each different class has a difference in stats, having their own identity and gimmick. There is also a save system I implemented to save after every boss defeated, so the user does not have to start from the beginning after defeat. These were the ideas that I had at the time, if I were to rethink the creative idea for a text based game I believe it would have an entirely different idea and concept.
 
This was a simple assignment used to access our knowledge of the topics we went over in our first semester. In all honesty, this was something that I am not proud, in terms of what I was able to produce. However, that is not to say I did not enjoy doing this assignment. It relied heavily on my creativity, which is something I lacked at the time. I was trying more on the side of meeting requirements and the due date rather than experimenting and finding more creative ways to make the idea that I had to be better. Something that I would consider adding would be a better/well-organized user interface. Along with graphics, showing more of the classes instead of it being plain words like “Warrior attacked Boss.” As wekk as audio to make the game feel more real, I would use simple sound effects such as a monster or attack sound effect. I want to believe that the topics that I am studying right now in software engineering would help me improve and maybe revise the ideas that I once had. This was the first project I have ever done for computer science. Although outcome is something I would describe as garbage, I was able to learn a lot about the process and resilience in creating something.
