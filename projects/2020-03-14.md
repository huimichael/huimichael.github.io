This was the first project done in ICS 212, it is the first project that I am doing in college studying ICS. The task was to build a bank simulation program that had a user interface, that allowed the user to select an option and execute it. Options such as adding a record, modifying a record, checking, and deleting. It used the data structure of linked lists, these lists contained elements of the user such as their name, address, and code. And of course, if the program is to add, modify, or delete items within the list, it also has to maintain it (that being the head and tail). This program also features a save and load type of feature, that takes after reading and writing. If the user exits the bank program, it writes all the data that the user has inputted into a text file, and when opened again all the data is read from the text file into the linked list.

In all honestly, this project was a new experience for me, not in terms of difficulty but the process that I had to go through. In the initial week of working on this project, I experienced many segmentation faults when testing this project. Then once that problem was resolved it had other issues figuring out the read and write functions (which also caused many segmentation faults). This entire project took roughly 3-4 consecutive days to finish. This entire project may not be amazing or as good compared to some other students among my class. But I was proud of what I was able to complete. The class I took and this project in some ways taught me the pain of being an ICS student. That there will be a lot of bugs and problem solving needed in order to succeed. And that making mistakes and retracing steps is how you find the answer.
