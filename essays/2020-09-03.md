## My Honest Feelings About Javascript

If someone were to ask me at this exact moment how I feel about Javascript, I would say it is met with a lot of displeasure as well as some headaches. What exposed me into learning this language was my software engineering class in college. Up to this point, I have only studied programming languages such as Java, C, and C++. My initial thoughts were “maybe Java and Javascript might be similar, it shouldn’t be that hard to pick up,” I was wrong. If I were to describe the programming languages that I know, in comparison to javascript, I would say the main difference is the organization. What I mean by that is the initialization of variables. For example, in C the common data types you have are int, double, char, boolean, and so on. Those common data types and how they are initialized are basic knowledge. Meanwhile, in Javascript, it seems you can shove anything into a var and in an array and it is valid.
