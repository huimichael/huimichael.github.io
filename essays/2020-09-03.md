## Current Feelings

If someone were to ask me at this exact moment how I feel about Javascript, I would say it is met with a lot of displeasure as well as some headaches. What exposed me to learning this language was my software engineering class. Up to this point, I have only studied programming languages such as Java, C, and C++. My initial thoughts were “maybe Java and Javascript might be similar, it shouldn’t be that hard to pick up,” I was wrong. If I were to describe the programming languages that I know, in comparison to javascript, I would say the main difference is the organization. What I mean by that is the initialization of variables. For example, in C the common data types you have are *int, double, char, boolean*, and so on. Those common data types and how they are initialized are basic knowledge. Meanwhile, in Javascript, it seems you can shove anything into a var and in an array and it is valid.

## Lack of Understanding

While the usage of variables is not inherently bad, I honestly consider it more of a nit-pick. The real problem that I do have is the lack of understanding of certain aspects with Javascript. Recently one of my homework assignments was to complete the introductory course for ES6, an enhancement to the Javascript language. When doing the introductory course I honestly felt like an idiot. Mainly the usage of the arrow notation, class definitions, promises, and template literals. In my opinion, I found these features difficult to grasp. I would be staring at my screen, trying to understand its usage and notation, but to no avail. These topics seem so alien to me, I do not recall encountering something of this nature from the previous programming languages that I have used. At this moment, I don't understand these notations and their uses/functions, but I'm sure in the near future I will have to get this down, gaining another headache with that knowledge.

## ICS 314

At this moment, I am currently taking a software engineering class, ICS 314. This is the class that exposed me to Javascript. In this class, we have these workout of the day assessments, otherwise known as WOD. These WOD's present a problem and tests your ability to find the solution it the most optimal time. I think these little assessments is what keeps me interested in Javascript. My most recent WOD, I was able to figure out the answer in the optimal time, but when I reviewed the professor's answer, I was supprised by the method he implemented. This made me think more about the possiblites that Javascript presents. I honestly like these assessments, it tests my current knowledge in being able to find a solution for given problems. It reminds me somewhat to the tracing practices that I had done in ICS 212 (Program Structure). I believe if I am to succeede in these assignments, I would have to change my thinking and invest more time into learning Javascript.

## Looking Forward

Despite these thoughts, I will decide to withhold judgment and opinion on Javascript. At the moment that I am writing this essay, I am one week into my software engineering class. As a new person learning javascript, my opinion is currently not worth listening to. While I do see the main difference between Javascript and the other programming languages that I have learned, all the things that I complained about in this essay are just the ramblings of a college student struggling in the first week. I do understand that there are a lot more opportunities and upside that come with learning this language, as there are many possibilities with software development and web development. In all honesty, it is false for me to say that I didn't learn anything from this language. I learned something that is outside of my comfort zone, even if that knowledge is minuscule and I believe that is the main take away. At this moment I do think that Javascript sucks, but who knows, as time moves on, I might come to like Javascript just a *little bit* more.
