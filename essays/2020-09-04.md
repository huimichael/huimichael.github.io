## Software Engineering

So far in College, I feel as if I have not experienced anything significant or beneficial towards my future. Many students say that the idea is that a student should seek opportunities and make acquaintance with fellow students and professors. In my case, I have not done any of that. There are many times where I have questioned whether or not I should conform to these ideas. I do recognize these problems that plague me and I genuinely want to work on them and some change is needed. I figured I should make a change this academic semester (Fall 2020) in particular with ICS 314: Software-Engineering I.

It is without a doubt that I believe ICS 314 will be a turning point in my college life. I have heard many positive things from this course and how it prepares students for the future such as establishing a portfolio, expectations for tech jobs, and projects done with various other students. Looking so far at the Modules that will be covered in this class are the ones that seem interesting to me are topics going over Javascript, user interface, web development; topics that I have no experience in. One of my goals for this course is to succeed in a variety of topics. As time is flying by I will get more or maybe fewer chances to establish myself and my resume. I want to be create something in this course I can be proud of, as I have not done any significant so far. As well as gain valuable skills and knowledge for me to confidently apply for internships. After this course, I want to say that I have the tools to apply for a real tech job.

A small goal that I always wanted to do was to create a game. The idea I have is to create a copy of a game, such as Snake, Chess, or even Battleship. Something where I can implement audio, graphics, and a user interface. I tried doing these kinds of projects on my own in the past, and the results are nowhere near my expectations. I also want to be able to some kind of project with some close friends of mine. And I think that ICS 314 would be the best place to gain experience collaborating with other students. I am excited about this course and what is shown so far, with the different modules and WOD practice helping us as practice.
