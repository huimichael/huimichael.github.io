## Inferiority

Let me be honest, at this moment I have no answer to the question: “what do you want to do?” What I would like to do is have a typical office tech job, while maintaining average or above living standards. I think of these as the ideal goals, I do not consider myself ambitious to desire something like a job at Google. But for me to work towards that idealization I need to prove my worth, like every other computer science student or worker, they need to be credible in their work. To show that they are capable and can be relied on. I, at this moment am not that, and in reality nowhere near that level of expectation. My entire college experience so far have been reactive to the events and opportunities around me, I have never been proactive. I want to show that I can reach that level, but I do believe that I am capable of doing things, but at this moment it is nothing more than a selfish desire. 

## A Goal

I want to do projects and work on something of value. But for the longest time, I have been plagued by the lack of motivation. My last semester (spring 2020), I told myself that, for summer break, I would work on something small. The idea that came to mind was to build a website. It was something that I’d hope to do, I thought I would make something simple, a similar idea to the Techfolios in ICS 314. And the bright side of competing it would lead to having exposure to HTML and CSS, topics that would be covered in ICS 314. But that did not happen, I lost the motivation to work on it halfway through.

## ICS 314

This made me think more about the idea of “purpose.” Who was I doing this for, what should be my reason for working toards this goal? As much as I want the answer to myself, that would be a lie. At this moment, I am studying ICS 314 (software engineering), I undoubtedly believe that this will be one of the most important classes in my college experience, if not the most. This class not only prepares you for the real world: working with others, the interview process, and even teaches you the skills to make something. My goal for this class is to learn software and web development, as I believe that these skills and knowledge will prove to be valuable for me in the future. Looking so far at the Modules that will be covered in this class are the ones that seem interesting to me are topics going over Javascript, user interface, and . Right now, I can easily make the excuse of not knowing enough to do such tasks. But I feel that after this semester, I should know software and web development; I should have made something meaningful in this class; and I should not make any more excuses, as they should no longer be valid.
