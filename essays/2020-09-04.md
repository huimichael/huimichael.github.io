## Software Engineering

So far in College, I feel as if I have not experienced anything significant or beneficial towards my future. Many students say that the idea is that a student should seek oppotunities and make acquaintance with fellow students and professors. In my case, I have not done any of that. There are many times where I have questioned whether or not I should confrom to these ideas. I do recognize these problems that plague me and I genuinely want to work on them and some change is needed. The first step torwards that would be this acedemic year (Fall 2020) and with ICS 314: Software Engineering I.

It is without a doubt that I believe ICS 314 will be a turning point in my college life. I have heard many positive things from this course and how it prepares students for the future such as establishing a portfolio, expectations for tech jobs, and projects done with various other students. I believe that one of my goals for this course is to succeed. As time is flying by I will get more or maybe less chances to really establish myself and my resume for the future. I want to be create something in this course I can be proud of, as I have not done any significant so far. As well as gain valuable skills and knowledge for me to confidently apply for internships. After this course I want to say that I have the tools to apply for a real tech job.
