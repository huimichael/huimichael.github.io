Let me be honest, at this moment I have no answer to the question: “what do you want to do?” What I would like to do is have a typical office tech job, while maintaining average or above living standards. I think of these as the ideal goals, I do not consider myself ambitious to desire something like a job at Google. But for me to work towards that idealization I need to prove my worth, like every other computer science student or worker, they need to be credible in their work. To show that they are capable and can be relied on. I, at this moment am not that, and in reality nowhere near that level of expectation. My entire college experience so far have been reactive to the events and opportunities around me, I have never been proactive. I want to show that I can reach that level, but I do believe that I am capable of doing things, but at this moment it is nothing more than a selfish desire.
