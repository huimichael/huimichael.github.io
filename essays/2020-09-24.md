## Overcoming Tendencies

  If being organized helps improve one’s flow of tasks and supports communication. Then neglecting the idea of organization, can simply be related to shooting one’s own foot.

  Within the field of computer science, there are guidelines that programmers and coders should follow. These guidelines essentially boil down to how one would write their own code. The number of spaces for an indentation, or how certain variables are decelerated, as well as point pointing out errors. Consider the situation where there are lines of code written.
```
let x = 2, y = “ABC”;        if(x === y.length) {return “Foo”;}
```
```
let x = 2;
let y = “ABC”;
if(x === y.length) { return “Foo”; }
```
```
let x = 2;
let y = “ABC”;
if (x === y.length) {
    return “Foo”; 
}
```
  From these three examples, it should be clear which one is the most comprehensive. Computer science should never be about saving lines of code, it is more important that when another person reads the code, they can easily understand it. Take this situation as an example, a company or a group of people run into a bug and they need to resolve it, but everyone has their way of writing code, that being different from one another. This situation requires more time allocated into understanding how one another’s code is structured rather the problem at hand. The main point of having computer scientists following a specific coding standard is to improve performance and work speed. This is equivalent to having a clean desk, you know where items and papers are by instinct, do not shoot yourself in the foot.

  With the transition to using an IDE in my software engineering class, there is the required usage of coding standards from ESLint. For me, this is not my first time using a coding standard in class, but for some reason, I find ESLint more troublesome. The reason being the setup for ESLint is not something I got down or used to yet, but from the uses, it has proven to be helpful. For me, I would like to consider myself an organized person, I like having my items and work in order. Personally I like having a coding standard such as ESLint in place, it can easily point out the typos made as well as having a specific style that improves readability. Getting a red checkmark might seem annoying to some, but I find it to be good that my errors are pointed out. If I were to compare it to ESLint to something, it would be the same as a calculator, it is a tool that helps one reach the answer. If there are certain tools that would help improve speed while still providing knowledge/understanding, then why not use it, that is how I view ESLint and coding standards.
