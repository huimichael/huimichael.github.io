## Software Engineering

 As the semester is nearing its end and as winter approaches, I want to reflect on the struggles and acquired knowledge from ICS 314: Software Engineering. Every week I learned a new module that built on the foundation of the previous module. There is a level of understanding that is gradually built upon. While I am no expert on all topics covered in the course taken, I believe there is at least a decent level of understanding from each module. I feel that I have improved in areas such as agile project management and configuration management. While those are some positives, I can say some areas need improvement such as functional programming.
 
To give a brief definition of configuration management, it is a process for maintaining computer systems, servers, and software in a desired, consistent state. It is to ensure changes that are made to a system still work as expected. The best configuration management application that I have used in software engineering is GitHub. Prior ICS 314, there have been a few cases where I had to use git commands in other courses, but those courses never really provided a good or fundamental understanding of what these commands do or why we were using them. The best way I would describe configuration management is creating a save point. Assume you created some complex dropdown for your application. But suddenly the next day, your entire application breaks due to that added feature, you can simply reload your previous save point to fix that problem. GitHub has a variety of uses such as: viewing changes made on a file, making branches, merging, committing, and using various git commands. I can see myself using this tool every time I have some kind of computer science assignment where I need to constantly check on my work progress and history.
	
Agile project management is “an iterative approach to managing software development projects that focuses on continuous releases and incorporating customer feedback with every iteration.” In short, it is the process of creating something in software development that requires planning, testing, and feedback. I was able to experience this first hand with a group for my ICS 314 final project. Our group had to constantly keep each other in check, seeing if everything was going well and ask questions on the status and progress. Questions such as:

<img class="ui image" href="https://dev.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/What-is-Agile-Software-Development.jpg" width = "100%" height = "auto">

- What type of design or color should we have this feature be?
- What days can we meet to discuss the current status and problems?
- How would this feature interact with this other feature?
- Is this current feature working properly with the test cases?
- When should we deploy the website? Is there anything else that needs to be done?

This was done to ensure good workflow and no one getting confused or lost. There were many problems and questions that needed to be addressed, and this cycle repated so many times for each new feature we decided to add/create. It was honestly troublesome and exhausting. I would say all of my group members had a certain point where they struggled with a problem and wanted to pull their hair out. But reflecting on it, I would say this was an amazing experience, being able to work with other people and come together and develop a working application. I think the skills and experience I gained from this group project will serve as a lesson for me when I have other group related projects or when I am in the workforce.

On the other hand, the one module that I struggle with is the application of functional programming. A brief definition: it is “the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.” In ICS 314, I believe that functional programming goes hand-in-hand with Javascript ES6. And I believe that is where my weakness comes from, a bad understanding of ES6.

Javascript ES6 introduces many new syntaxes and functionality that I was not familiar with nor was I able to keep up with learning. I think it just due to familiarity, I am more comfortable with procedural programming because that is how I was taught to write code. But I would like to give myself the benefit of the doubt, if I had more time and more experience with using Javascript and ES6, I do think that I can turn this weakness into another strength. 

At the beginning of taking ICS 314, I said that this course is the turning point in studying computer science. I still standby that statement. I believe that all the knowledge and experience accumulated in ICS 314 will carry some weight in pursuing a job in computer science. In ICS 314, everything was gradually building upon each other. I can not say I have mastered every topic covered, but can surely say that the knowledge I have gained will surely continue to grow. From the basics of Javascript; to HTML/CSS; to Meteor and the uses of databases; hopefully I get another opportunity to display all these skills in the near future.
