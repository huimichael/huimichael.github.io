## Software Engineering

 As the semester is nearing its end and as winter approaches, I would like to reflect on the struggles and acquired knowledge in ICS 314: Software Engineering. Every week I learned a new module that built on the foundation of the previous module. There is a level of understanding that is gradually built upon. While I am no expert on all topics covered in the course taken, I believe there is at least a level of understanding for each module, but I am unable to put it into words. I feel that I have improved in areas such as agile project management and configuration management. While those are some positives, I can say some areas need improvement such as functional programming.
 
	To give a brief definition of configuration management, it is a process for maintaining computer systems, servers, and software in a desired, consistent state. It is to ensure changes that are made to a system still work as expected. The best configuration management application that I have used in software engineering is GitHub. Before ICS 314, there have been a few cases where I had to use git commands in other courses, but those courses never really provided a good or fundamental understanding of what these commands do or why we were using them. The best way I would describe configuration management is creating a save point. Assume you created some complex dropdown for your application. But suddenly the next day, your entire application breaks due to that added feature, you can simply reload your previous save point to fix that problem. GitHub has a variety of uses from seeing changes made on a file, making branches, merging, committing, and using various git files. I can see myself using this tool every time I have some kind of computer science assignment where I need to constantly check on my work progress.
	
	Agile project management is “an iterative approach to managing software development projects that focuses on continuous releases and incorporating customer feedback with every iteration.” I was able to experience this first hand with a group for my final project. There were decisions that my group had to make. Questions such as:
- What type of design or color there should we have our website be?
- What days can we meet to discuss the current status and problems?
- How would this feature interact with this other feature?
- Is this current feature working properly with the test cases?
- When should we deploy the website? Is there anything else that needs to be done?

	There were many problems and questions that needed to be addressed. It was honestly troublesome and exhausting. I would say all of my group members had a certain point where they struggled with a certain problem and wanted to pull their hair out. But reflecting on it, I would say this was an amazing experience, being able to work with other people and come together and develop a working application. I think the skills and experience I gained from this group project will serve as a lesson for me when I have other group related projects or when I am in the workforce.

On the other hand, the one module that I struggle with is the application of functional programming. A brief definition: it is “the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.” In ICS 314, I believe that functional programming goes hand-in-hand with Javascript ES6. And I believe that is where my weakness comes from, a bad understanding of ES6. Javascript ES6 introduces many new syntaxes and functionality that I was not familiar with nor was I able to keep up with learning. I think it just due to familiarity, I am more comfortable with procedural programming because that is how I was taught to write code. But I would like to give myself the benefit of the doubt, if I had more time and more experience with using Javascript and ES6, I do think that I can turn this weakness into another strength. 

At the beginning of taking ICS 314, I predicted that this course is the turning point in studying computer science. I still standby that thought. I certainly believe that all the knowledge and experience accumulated will carry some weight in pursuing a job in computer science. In ICS 314, everything was gradually building upon each other. I can not say I have mastered every topic covered, but can surely say that the knowledge I have gained will surely continue to grow. From the basics of Javascript; to HTML/CSS; to Meteor and the uses of databases; all was shown in the final project.
