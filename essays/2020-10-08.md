For me, I can say that styling with HTML or CSS is not my strong point. It is easy to put all the necessary information and pictures onto an HTML document, but it takes another level to style it. I studied plain HTML and CSS the previous summer, in the attempts to create my own website, and I can honestly say that styling HTML was one of the most infuriating things I have put myself through. There were many things that had to be considered: margins, padding, position of images, and alignment of text. I gave up on this project due to the level of difficulty that came with this project. And then I learned about Semantic UI this week, which can be described as revolutionary. It made me feel like an old man who learned about a new piece of technology. 

If I had to make a comparison to using Semantic UI, I would compare it to cooking. It takes patience and precision when cooking food, I would argue the idea applies to styling with Semantic UI. Specifically when describing the class for elements. Suppose you have a div tag with the class “ui yellow three item menu.” The result is a menu with three items; when clicked on it turns yellow. In some ways you can describe food in the same light; “a yellow three equal length medium size cake.” Granted no one (probably) orders food to that level of detail but the idea can be that the food made already has specific attributes already. You essentially the customer requesting a specific style and Semantic UI is the chef outputting your request.
