## Foundations

When creating anything, it is always easy to envision the end goal of the product. But to begin a foundation needs to be set. In computer science, the foundation that is used in our products is one of many different design patterns, each serving a different purpose. To give a general definition of design patterns it is “a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.” I think the best way to explain this topic is to use a video game analogy. Suppose there is a strong boss that the player needs to defeat. You have the option of picking different classes to go up against that boss. What do you the player pick, a knight: use brute force; tank: high health; mage: high mobility and relies on spells; or another class that has its own perks. There is no right answer, if anything it depends on your playstyle. I think that decision applies to design patterns. The class you picked is the design pattern you decided on is your foundation, with its own pros and cons to help you, the developer, solve your problem. 

There are major benefits to using design patterns. One is it provides the framework or groundwork to solve these issues in software development. Deciding to use a specific design pattern shapes the development process of the application. Meaning when working on a team of developers it improves the communication between developers as everyone is following the same pattern. After doing some research on design patterns, in my opinion, I would say these are 5 design patterns that are common and important.
Singleton: Restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. In other words, it allows usage of the instance as a global variable
Factory: Similar to a real factory, it defines an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate
Observer: named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods
Builder: provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming
Adapter: allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface
